By this way, we can capsule the important attributes into a capsule so as to avoid or limit the unauthorised access. We can do this via accessors and mutators. It is essential in software development because when we work for real world scenarios, we have huge and complex data with so many crucial information. If this data goes to unreliable hands, it will cost a huge amount of money to the company organisation or the owner of data. So, we need to protect our data from unauthorized access. We need to ensure that our data gets modified only when required and it can be modified by authorised members only. For this purpose, we put some limitation on the access of data via encapsulation."

Delegation is a design pattern in which an object, called the delegate, is responsible for performing certain tasks on behalf of another object, called the delegator. While designing the complex systems, in a class, we sometimes need to perform some computations on the output of methods of another class. For this, we need to go into into deep detailing or inheritance, we just need to instantiate the object of that class and use the properties of its method."
