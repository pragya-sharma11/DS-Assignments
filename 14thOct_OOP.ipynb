By this way, we can capsule the important attributes into a capsule so as to avoid or limit the unauthorised access. We can do this via accessors and mutators. It is essential in software development because when we work for real world scenarios, we have huge and complex data with so many crucial information. If this data goes to unreliable hands, it will cost a huge amount of money to the company organisation or the owner of data. So, we need to protect our data from unauthorized access. We need to ensure that our data gets modified only when required and it can be modified by authorised members only. For this purpose, we put some limitation on the access of data via encapsulation."
